# Netbeast style guide

## Main components

- Generic bootstrap Sass styles
- app.scss (This includes the bootstrap base and our custom tweaks)
- _customVariables.scss (This file stores the custom values for most of the current styles (e.g. border radius, widths, colors, all the bullshit you can think of).
- custom.scss (This file stores custom mods to the bootstrap base styles that cannot be done using custom variables).

## Recomendations

- New changes are highly recommended to be included in customVars
